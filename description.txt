Are you tired of playing Terraria on singleplayer, alone, with Terraria boring npcs? This mod will 
solve that issue for you.

I introduce to you the TerraGuardians; creatures of many shapes and sizes that are appearing on 
Terrarians dimension for unknown reasons.
You can meet these unique characters during your travels, you can befriend them, ask them to follow you 
on your quests, leave them living on your world, and much more.
Beside this mod adds TerraGuardians, it also adds some Terrarian companions that you can recruit too, 
each with their unique look and personality.

This mod is in constant development, so new companions will appear in your game as the mod updates, 
with more of the mod lore to be unfolded.

In case of incompatibilities, I can try fixing it on my side, but some of them might require the 
modder of the other mod to get involved.

And like always, Have Fun :)

Known Incompatibilities:
- Terraria Overhaul
-> Some features will affect companions, not in a really good way depeding on the case.
- Souls from Fargo Souls will crash the game when equipped on companions.
-> If you end up having that issue, disable temporarily Fargo Souls mod, and remove the item from the companions with them equipped.
-> It's safe to re-enable the mod later, just don't give them any Souls for now.
