		// oldpartner: Irene
		//greet
		// greet1: Hey, who are you? Are you my newest friend?
		// greet2: More friends? I like that!
		// greet3: Yay! I've met more people!
		//normal
		// normal1: Yay! I've met more people!
		// normal2: Don't worry, I'll protect you from any danger.
		// normal3: I'm sure you would like to meet [oldpartner]. Well, she was a bit closed off to other people, but she was my best pal, and that's what matters, I guess?
		// normal4: I wonder if [oldpartner]'s tombstone is alright. Should I check on it later?
		// normal5: A number of Terrarians kept asking me how I managed to place [oldpartner]'s tombstone in so many weird places, so now I learned how to place them properly.
		// normal6: Whaaaaaaaaaaat? You can't place tombstones on trees? Or plants? Or in the water?
		// normal7: "[nn:22] taught me how to place things in the correct places properly, and now I can't place them in the wrong place."
		// normal8: Stay near me and you'll be safe.
		// normal9: So many things to bite outside.
		// normal10: I think I saw some of those guys in some movies I watched with [oldpartner].
		// normal11: I don't fear any of those monsters outside. The only thing I fear is the monster Legion, but It doesn't exist in this world.
		// normal12: This day seems alright for playing outside!
		// normal13: The rain would spoil all the fun if it weren't for the puddles.
		// normal14: I still have two AA batteries to be depleted, so let's play a game!
		// normal15: This night reminds me of an adventure I had with [oldpartner]. That makes me miss her.
		// normal16: When you are not around, I play some Hide and Seek with [gn:0]. He's terrible at hiding. His tail gives him away, but It's fun always finding him
		// normal17: Do you know why [gn:0] eats [nn:17]'s trash? I'd join him but, [oldpartner] taught me that eating trash is bad.
		// normal18: I fertilized [gn:1]'s yard, and she thanked me by chasing me while swinging her broom at me. I guess we are besties now.
		// normal19: "[gn:1] looked very upset when I was playing with her red cloak. By the way, tell her that you didn't see me if she asks."
		// normal20: Why does [gn:1] watch [gn:2] and I play? Why doesn't she join us in the fun? That would be better than staring, right?
		// normal21: "[gn:2] called me to go on an adventure, I wonder if you will mind that."
		// normal22: I asked earlier if [gn:3] was using one of his bones. His answer was very rude.
		// normal23: I tried to cheer [gn:3] on. He threw a frisbee for me to catch, but when I returned, he wasn't there. Where did he go?
		// normal24: Why do [gn:3] and [gn:1] look a bit sad when they meet each other? Aren't they dating?
		// normal25: What's with [gn:4]? He never shows any kind of emotion when I talk to him. Even when we play.
		// normal26: I don't really have any fun when playing with [gn:4] because he doesn't seem to be having fun.
		// normal27: I've got [gn:0] and [gn:2] to play with me. I guess my new dream will be for everyone in the village to play together.
		// normal28: I think sometimes [gn:7] feels lonely, so I stay nearby to make her feel less lonely.
		// normal29: I smell a variety of things inside of [gn:7]'s bag, including food. Can you persuade her to open her bag and show us what is inside?
		// normal30: I love playing with [gn:8]. The other person that played as much with me was [oldpartner].
		// normal31: I'm up to playing some more. Do you know if [gn:8] is free?
		// normal32: (He's watching the horizon. Maybe he's thinking about something?)
		// normal33: I have been talking with [gn:11] and... No... Forget it... Nevermind what I was going to say.
		// normal34: That [gn:11] is a real buddy. He accompanies me when I go visit [oldpartner]'s Tombstone. I don't feel alone when doing that anymore.
		// normal35: I've got a new friend, and the name is [gn:13]. What? I'm still your buddy too.*
		// normal36: *Whine~whine* [gn:14] is a mean guy, I tried playing with him, and then he gets really mad at me.
		// normal37: I try making [gn:14] feel better, but he always yells at me.
		// normal38: I don't know why some people are scared of [gn:16], she's a good person. I like her.
		// normal39: I love playing with [gn:16]. She always knows my favorite petting spot.
		// normal40: Sometimes [gn:0] and [gn:16] play with me. It's like a dream come true. I wish they could do that more often.
		// normal41: "[nickname]... I'm working hard... With the help of [gn:25]... To get stronger... and protect you..."
		// normal42: I'm exhausted... [gn:25]'s exercises are hardcore... But I'm feeling stronger.
		// normal43: I like [gn:26], she always rubs my belly when I ask.
		// normal44: Who is [tggodname]? Is he [gn:33] friend? If he is, he is my friend too.
		// normal45: I sometimes lie next to [gn:33] when she's kneeling. She always pets me on the back of my head after that.
		// normal46: "[gn:34] looked sad about hearing of what happened to [oldpartner]. She said that wouldn't have happened if she met us earlier..."
		// normal47: Whenever I pass through [gn:34], she pets my head and call me a good boy. I like that.
		// normal48: It's odd the scent [gn:34] has. No other female in the world has a scent such as hers. Like, other females smell good.
		// normal49: I'm trying hard to aim at the hole.
		// normal50: Is this how you humans use a toilet? It's very hard for me to use it.
		// normal51: You'll sleep in my bedroom? That's awesome! I will keep you protected while you sleep.
		// normal52: You'll share your bed with me? This is the best day ever!
		// normal53: (He's moving his paws while sleeping, maybe he's dreaming that he's running?)
		// normal54: No... Don't go... No... (He seems to be having a nightmare)
		// normal55: (You can hear his silent snores.)
		// normal56: Who's she? Is she your friend? Can she play with me?
		// normal57: I'm happy that evil bad eye wont try hurting us anymore.
		// normal58: *Bark, bark!* Big eye! In the sky! *Bark, bark!*
		// normal59: I'm really happy with that big bone you gave me to chew. They keep my teeth busy.
		// normal60: *Whine, whine* Why this place feels so odd? It's like something changed.
		// normal61: Some scary new creatures are showing up in the world.
		// normal62: I've met a new friend. [gn:35] is his name. He plays with me a lot.
		// normal63: I really don't like [gn:38]. He seems like bad person.
		// normal64: I'd love to bite [gn:38] backside, but everyone else scolds me for trying.
		//sleeping
		// sleeping1: (He's moving his paws while sleeping, maybe he's dreaming that he's running?)
		// sleeping2: No... Don't go... No... (He seems to be having a nightmare)
		// sleeping3: (You can hear his silent snores.)
		//request
		// request1: Other than playing? I want nothing else.
		// request2: I'm full of energy if that's what you mean.
		// request3: I really need something to be done. What? You thought I was into playing 24/7? I also have my things too other than that. Can you do this for me? [objective]?
		// request4: There is a thing I need to be done, can you help me with it? I need to [objective], but I think I may need help with it...
		// request5: Yay! You're the best!
		// request6: You did it! Yay!
		// request7: You'll do It? Woof!
		// request8: Won't you get overloaded? You seem to have lots to do already.
		// request9: Whine.. Whine.. It's okay.. It was a silly request anyway..
		// request10: Not now? Try helping me with this later. Woof!
		// request11: You couldn't do it? Don't worry. *He seems to be trying to cheer you up now*
		// request12: Did you do it? Did you do it?
		// request13: You forgot? It's fine! I asked you to [objective].
		// request14: Yipee! Wait, what? You don't want to do that for me?
		// request15: *Whine whine* Fine... I'm not sad or anything...
		// request16: *Happily wags his tail*
		//join
		// join1: You're taking me out for a walk? Cool! I'll get the leash.

		//leave
		// leave1: You're going to leave me here? All alone?
		// leave2: Okay! I'll be waiting for your return. Woof!
		// leave3: Alright... I'll be heading home then...
		// leave4: Woof! Amazing!
		// leave5: Woof! No way. I'll follow you for a bit longer.
		//talk
		// talk1: My old partner once said that I had C batteries in my body. What is that supposed to mean?
		// talk2: You're the best, let's play a game?
		// talk3: "[oldpartner] and I were the best friends ever! I should've followed my instincts and stopped her."
		// talk4: "[gn:0] and I are trying to guess who's your best friend. Can you tell me?"
		// talk5: Maybe I should tell you why [oldpartner] isn't with us anymore... She tried to protect me from flying bugs in the purple place... I should be the one protecting her, not the inverse.
		//movein
		// movein1: Woof! Woof! You've got a house for me? Woof! Woof! I'm so happy!
		// movein2: I think now isn't the best moment for that.
		// movein3: No. I still need to guard [oldpartner]'s tombstone.

		// greet1: *You! No, you aren't the Terrarian I'm looking for. I can smell it.*
		// greet2: *You, stop! *snif snif* Hmmm... No, you're not who I wanted to find.*
		// greet3: *Hold on. *snif, snif snif, snif* Hm... I was checking if you were who I'm looking for, and you are not.*
		//normal
		// normal1: *Whatever It is, couldn't wait?*
		// normal2: *[nickname], I'm trying to process some things here.*
		// normal3: *Your presence here is making It harder for me to finish what I'm doing.*
		// normal4: *Any update on our little investigation?*
		// normal5: *This mystery is making me intrigued. I've never found something like this before.*
		// normal6: *Is there something you seek, [nickname]?*
		// normal7: *Did you found the Terrarian we are looking for? I can't blame if you didn't, my description is really vague.*
		// normal8: *I can identify anyone by sleuthing them, but not everyone may like that idea.*
		// normal9: *Everytime I sleuth someone, I can replicate part of their strength.*
		// normal10: *I can identify Terrarians by sleuthing them, but I don't get stronger by doing so.*
		// normal11: *The only clue I've got from my investigation, is the scent of a unknown terrarian that was at that place. I will find the one who has that scent.*
		// normal12: *If it's about [nn:54], I already checked if he was the terrarian, and he's not.*
		// normal13: *I have troubles getting into sleep, my head is always filled with thoughts when I get my head on the pillow.*
		// normal14: *The stars sometimes help me with my thoughts. Lying down on the ground and staring upwards has a mind opening effect.*
		// normal15: *The sound of rain drops have a soothening effect.*
		// normal16: *I don't feel comfortable investigating while exposed to the sun, I get some annoying headaches when I do that.*
		// normal17: *How old is [gn:0]? It doesn't seems like he's that old.*
		// normal18: *I'm intrigued at how [gn:0] lives his life. Maybe that's another mystery.*
		// normal19: *[gn:1] came earlier wanting me to help her find someone. I'm trying to do something to help her, but that's delaying my personal investigation.*
		// normal20: *Looks like [gn:1] lost someone too... I wonder if It's the same as... No, certainly not...*
		// normal21: *I think I discovered some clue about [gn:1]'s missing person. I heard that someone that meets the description seems to show up during Blood Moons, on the edges of the world. You better you be careful.*
		// normal22: *It's good to see that [gn:1] has found who she was looking for, but the result even I didn't expected.*
		// normal23: *I was shocked when I discovered [gn:3] fate, but [gn:1]'s reception to that seems to be the reward by Itself.*
		// normal24: *[gn:7] told me that she's looking for her husband. The only clue I got is that he were pursuing the King Slime. I think that may be dangerous, actually.*
		// normal25: *I can't really stay in the same room as [gn:8], she simply distracts me.*
		// normal26: *I wonder what kind of thing [gn:8] would like... Wait, I shouldn't be thinking about that kind of thing.*
		// normal27: *You should keep a closer eye to [gn:12], she caused many troubles in the ether realm, on every village she came from.*
		// normal28: *Never speak with [gn:12] during a Blood Moon. She catches anyone who tries speaking with her to force doing experiments on.*
		// normal29: *A TerraGuardian fragmented into 4 emotions... Where could the others be...?*
		// normal30: *Sometimes I hang around with [gn:6], he sometimes gives me ideas for clues I need on my investigations.*
		// normal31: *I often have to ask [gn:6] for help to try investigating some place.*
		// normal32: *I sleuthed [gn:13], and she's not the one I'm looking for.*
		// normal33: *I was unable to caught [gn:4] scent, no matter how hard I tried. I really hope he isn't the one I'm looking for.*
		// normal34: *[gn:26] is really furious about the fact that I know many things about her.*
		// normal35: *I will get to know [gn:26] more some time...*
		// normal36: *It's really great having a medic around. Or at least one that knows how TerraGuardian bodies works.*
		// normal37: *Yeah, I don't mind sharing my room with you, as long as you have a bed for yourself.*
		// normal38: *You think I sleuth you during your sleep? What else do I need to discover about you?*
		// normal39: *I don't mean to alarm you, but there is a ghost behind you.*
		// normal40: *I've been noticing some new monsters showing up in the world. Do you know anything about that?*
		// normal41: *What is going on? Why there's towers all over the world?*
		// normal42: *You've destroyed a stone creature in a temple inside the Jungle? That doesn't smell good...*
		// normal43: *Is there any particular reason why familiar looking mechanical abominations are showing up?*
		// normal44: *You have managed to bring peace to this land, [nickname]. We can finally enjoy peace now.*
		//talk
		// talk1: *I wonder if they are fine... Who? The people I'm looking for, of course..*
		// talk2: *I used to be part of a group with 3 Terrarians, but then they disappeared after... Something happened..*
		// talk3: *My only hope is finding that Terrarian who made seems involved into my friends disappearance. If I find him, I may find a clue of where they could be.*
		//request
		// request1: *No.*
		// request2: *Not yet.*
		// request3: *I can't get myself distracted from my investigation, so I need your help to [objective]. Can you do that for me?*
		// request4: *There is something else catching my attention, but It would be a great time saving if you did It for me. I need you to [objective], and then report back your progress. What do you say?*
		// request5: *It's good to know that I can count on you. I think this will suit the time you spent.*
		// request6: *You completed what I asked for, then? Good. This is a compensation for the time you spent.*
		// request7: *Perfect. Return to me when you manage to finish It.*
		// request8: *Even I don't get myself overloaded with things to do. So don't ask me for a request while you have others pending.*
		// request9: *I don't think I will manage to have the time to do It, but I'll try.*
		// request10: *I may end up doing It myself that way...*
		// request11: *Have you don't what I asked you to do?*
		// request12: *You don't really have good memory, right? Just do this to me, [objective].*
		// request13: *Is this request too complicated for you? I may relieve you from It if you want.*
		// request14: *Hm... Okay, you may get it out of your head now.*
		// request15: *Good.*
		//revive
		// revive1: *Come on... You've got to help me solve the mystery.*
		// revive2: *I think I just need to do this... It's working.*
		// revive3: *Those wounds... No, I will try tending them still.*
		// revive4: *Hold on.*
		// revive5: *I know you're feeling pain, but try not to move.*
		// revive6: *If It helps, hold my paw.*
		// revive7: *You're in a safe place now, let me take care of those wounds.*
		// revive8: *I'm here.*
		// revive9: *You all did good. Thanks.*
		// revive10: *I apreciate the help, I really mean It.*
		// revive11: *You could have helped me. I'm fine now, by the way.*
		// revive12: *That was because of my sleuthing, right?*

		// recruitfamiliar4: *Anyway, If you need me, I'll be around.*
		// recruittalk1: *Terrarian. [gender]. [companions]
		// recruittalk1hascompanions: and you seems to have met some TerraGuardians.*
		// recruittalk1nocompanions: and It must be a shock for you to see me.*
		// recruitanswer1-1: Why did you jumped on me?
		// recruitanswer1-2: You could have asked, instead.
		// recruittalk2: *I had to make sure if you were the person I am looking for, and I simply have you try to run away.*
		// recruitanswer2: Who are you looking for?
		// recruittalk3: *That's not what I wanted to know. It wouldn't be necessary to catch you to know those informations.*
		// recruitanswer3: Then why you jumped on me?
		// recruittalk4: *There is a Terrarian, who seems to be involved in the disappearance of my friends.*
		// recruitanswer4: A Terrarian? Why a Terrarian?
		// recruittalk5: *I know by the scent. The last place I caught my friends scent, had that unfamiliar scent too. That's the only clue I've got from my friends disappearance. My sleuthing is very accurate, which explains why I caught you, just to make sure.*
		// recruitanswer5: And why you're investigating here?
		// recruittalk6: *That same scent, I caught it down here too. That Terrarian must be, or have been in this world, so I needed to investigate further.*
		// recruitanswer6: So, you plan on looking around this place more?
		// recruittalk7: *That's what I intend to do. I do have a request for you: I need somewhere safe to gather clues and try finding out more pieces of this puzzle. Would you mind if I stay in this world for a while?*
		// recruitanswer7-1: Yes, you may stay here.
		// recruitanswer7-2: No, you can't stay here.
		// recruittalk8: *Thank you, Terrarian. My name is [name]. If you find a suspicious Terrarian, bring him to me.*
		// recruittalk9: *I see... Anyways, my name is [name]. If you change your mind, or find a suspicious Terrarian in your world, you just need to call me. I'll visit your world regularly looking for clues. Until another time.*
