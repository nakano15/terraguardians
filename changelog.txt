Scaleforth's Right wing will now be dyed alongside his body.
Fixed a issue where Scaleforth's Right wing had less frames on the spritesheet than expected.
Made Rename Companion command case sensitive, so it will no longer set custom companion names to lower case.
Moved the position of Sub Attack icons on companion health and mana infos to a bit lower, so it doesn't show up over character name.
Giant companions will now be downscaled on the companions selection interface, no longer obstructing name or clipping through interface.
Fixed draw order when Vladimir is hugging another companion.
Changed the method the game uses for saving companions common data, to avoid security related errors of preventing companion infos from being saved.
