When Bond-Merged with a companion, if the controlled companion end up dying, your character will die aswell.
Added new CompanionBase setting: "SetArmRelocationPosition"
 => This animation position container, will change the arm position based on the difference between the body frame and the arm frame arm locations.
 => That's handy if an animation moves the companion arm somewhere else.
 => Better set a default position for the arm if you plan on using it. Or not mess with it at all if you don't want to.
