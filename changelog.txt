Fixed a issue where when speaking with Alexander for the first time, both alternatives you had had the same text, beside different dialogue outcomes.
You can now ask companions to play Rock, Paper and Scissors with you.
 => Go in their dialogues, on the option "I just want to chat.", then click "Lets play a game." to find it.
 => Something terrible will happen if either you or the companion win more than 255 times.
