When Bond-Merged with a companion, if the controlled companion end up dying, your character will die aswell.
(For modders) Added new CompanionBase setting: "SetArmRelocationPosition"
 => This animation position container, will change the arm position based on the difference between the body frame and the arm frame arm locations.
 => That's handy if an animation moves the companion arm somewhere else.
 => Better set a default position for the arm if you plan on using it. Or not mess with it at all if you don't want to.
Added dialogue that lets you give food to hungry companions.
 => Feeding them will increase your friendship experience with them.
 => Most companions have a favorite food. Good luck finding them.
 => (For modders) There's a hook to manage which kinds of items could be considered as food, and what buff to give.
Companions can no longer spot invisible players.
On New Combat AI, companions will be forced to return to owner if they move too far from the owner, when chasing something.
Generic Companions now have a chance of spawning when moving.
